## Developing

### Prerequisites

Ensure redis is installed (`brew install redis`).

### Running locally

```
PUPPETEER_SKIP_CHROMIUM_DOWNLOAD=true npm ci
npm run dev
```

`npm run dev` will set all necessary environment variables needed to run the application.

A debugger can be attached to debug server-side code.

### Testing

If components have changed, snapshot tests may need to be updated. Backstop js visual regression tests may also need to be updated.

To update jest snapshots:

```
npx jest -u
```

To update backstopJS snapshots:

```
docker build -t georgegillams-test -f Dockerfile.backstopjstest .
docker run georgegillams-test
docker cp DOCKER_CONTAINER_ID:/usr/src/tmp/backstop_data ./
```

Any changes resulting from these commands should be verified and checked in.

## Hosting

The following environment variables should be set up

| Env var             | Reason                                 | Value                                                                     |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| GSUITE_APP_PASSWORD | To send emails from your Gmail account | The password generated to access yout G-Suite account                     |
| GSUITE_EMAIL        | To send emails from your Gmail account | Your G-Suite email address                                                |
| REDIS_URL           | To access the redis database.          | If no URL is provided, the server will connect to a local redis instance. |
| SECRET_API_KEY      | Used to make admin API requests        | Anything secret and impossible to guess                                   |

### Hosting on Heroku

To host this on Heroku, you will need to add the [Heroku-redis Add-on](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-redis). Doing so will create a the REDIS_URL environment variable required to connect to the DB.
